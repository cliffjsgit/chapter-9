#Chapter 9

In these review exercises, you will be reviewing the basic Python techniques that are presented in the exercises of Think Python Chapters 9. 

Start by cloning the Chapters 1-8 Exercises into you local repository.
     
     $ cd ~
     $ git clone https://github.com/cliffjsgit/chapter-9
     

Once you have cloned this repo, you may proceed to the labs.
    
     $ cd ~/chapter-9
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ ls
     

Create a solutions directory for you exercise solutions, in the python-review directory.
      
      ~/chapter9 (master)$ mkdir solutions
      
Copy all of your final/completed lab solutions from all problems 
into the solutions directory.  
    ~/chapter9 (master)$ cp chapter9/exercise*  solutions/
    
     
     ~/chapter9/solutions (master)$ cd ..
     ~/chapter9 (master)$ cp chapter9/exercise* solutions/
     ...
    
Make sure that you copy all of your completed exercise solutions from this chapter
into your **single**  ~/chapter9/solutions directory, 
preserving the orignal file names of the exercises.
