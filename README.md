#Chapter 9

In these review exercises, you will be reviewing the basic Python techniques that are presented in the exercises of Think Python Chapter 9. 

Start by cloning the Chapter 9 Exercises into you local repository.
     
     $ cd ~
     $ git clone https://github.com/cliffjsgit/chapter-9
     

Once you have cloned this repo, you may proceed to the labs.
    
     $ cd ~/chapter-9
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ ls
     ...

Create a solutions directory for your exercise solutions, in the chapter-9 directory.
      
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ mkdir solutions
      
Copy all of your final/completed chapter-9 lab **exercise solutions** from all exercise 
problems, and the **words.txt** file into the solutions directory.  
    
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ cp exercise*  solutions/ 
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ cp words.txt  solutions/
     ...
    
Make sure that you copy all of your completed exercise solutions and the words.txt file
from this chapter into your **single**  ~/chapter9/solutions directory, 
preserving the orignal file names of these files.
