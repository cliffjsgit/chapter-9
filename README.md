#Chapter 9

In these review exercises, you will be reviewing the basic Python techniques that are presented in the exercises of Think Python Chapter 9. 

Start by cloning the Chapter 9 Exercises into you local repository.
     
     $ cd ~
     $ git clone https://github.com/cliffjsgit/chapter-9
     

Once you have cloned this repo, you may proceed to the labs.
    
     $ cd ~/chapter-9
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ ls
     ...

Create a solutions directory for your exercise solutions, in the chapter-9 directory.
      
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ mkdir solutions
      
Copy all of your final/completed lab chapter-9 solutions from all exercise problems 
into the solutions directory.  
    
     ~/chapter-9 (master)$ cp exercise*  solutions/ 
     ...
    
Make sure that you copy all of your completed exercise solutions from this chapter
into your **single**  ~/chapter9/solutions directory, preserving the orignal 
file names of the exercises.
